# Terminal
A configurable browser based javascript shell complete with virtual file system.  This shell uses a bash style command system, and is a hybrid between DOS and Linux commands.

This project is largely written in vanilla Javascript, and is installed and run on a client system.  Aside from a Javascript browser, all dependancies are included in the project (ie no need for Node.js, React, jQuery etc etc).

Import and export of the virtual filesystem and file system commands are still under development.

Start by opening terminal.html in a browser window, and type man from the subsequent command prompt.
